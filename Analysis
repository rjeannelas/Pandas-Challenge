#### After creating the code analysis from the dataset, it was apparent that the percent of students passing reading and their average reading score is higher than 
the percent of students passing math and their average math score, which shows that students are doing better in reading than math. The difference in variables between
the type of schools can relay with more observations. When comparing the highest performing schools and the lowest performing schools, Charter schools excel overall compared to District schools. 

## 2. 
#### The school summary was able to show that some of the district schools have more students than 8 charter schools, with a total of 15 schools and 39,170. 
Student budgets, spending ranges, as well as total students for each school can dramatically affect the performance per student and the school's overall passing rate.
For example, a higher overall passing rate of 90.37 percent in the lower spending ranges (<$585).

## 3. 
#### The data clearly shows that Charter schools are scoring better than District schools across all data used to chowcase the obvious trends of school performance
(average, percent, and overall). But it has also shown the data changing with each trend effecting each other. The increase in budget per student and population, etc. 
effecting the average scores between the school types. Schools can have better scores and a smaller student population while other schools have lower scores and larger 
student population, if we base off of this factor alone schools with larger student population can also negatively influence overall passing rate and percentage of schools.
